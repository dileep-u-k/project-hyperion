> ### **The Problem**
> Running AI at planetary-scale is a battle against two forces: **cost and latency**. Deploying models on powerful cloud GPUs is expensive and slow for end-users. Deploying on the edge is fast but complex and hard to manage. How can you get the best of both worlds without an army of infrastructure engineers?

### **The Solution: An Autonomous AI Fabric**

**Project Hyperion** answers this challenge with an autonomous, AI-defined control plane that transforms a global, heterogeneous collection of compute resources‚Äîfrom massive cloud GPUs to tiny edge devices‚Äîinto a single, intelligent, self-optimizing fabric.

It uses **Reinforcement Learning** to learn the optimal placement for any AI workload, autonomously shifting tasks between cloud and edge to slash costs and crush latency. Think of it as a cloud architect and a global network engineer, condensed into a single, intelligent system.

### ‚ú® **Core Features**

* **üß† Intelligent & Adaptive Scheduling:** Leverages a Reinforcement Learning model that continuously learns and adapts to real-world conditions. It makes optimal placement decisions based on a rich set of telemetry including cloud spot pricing, network latency, GPU utilization, and carbon efficiency.

* **‚ö° High-Performance Global Fabric:** Built on a foundation of **gRPC over QUIC**, the fabric provides a secure, low-latency communication layer essential for real-time control over distributed edge devices, enabling sub-10ms scheduling decisions.

* **‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Predictive & Proactive Healing:** Utilizes time-series ML models on Prometheus metrics to anticipate node failures and network degradation. It proactively rebalances workloads *before* an outage occurs, ensuring a level of resilience far beyond traditional reactive systems.

### üö¶ **Project Status**

**Current Phase:** `Phase 0: The Architect's Blueprint`

The project's foundational architecture and professional development environment are now complete. The next phase focuses on implementing the core orchestration logic. See the full plan in our [whitepaper](./docs/whitepaper.md).
