## üî≠ Vision

The future of AI is distributed. However, managing AI workloads across a heterogeneous mix of public clouds, private data centers, and edge devices is cripplingly complex and expensive. **Project Hyperion** is an AI-defined infrastructure project designed to solve this. It creates a single, intelligent control plane that treats the world's compute as one unified resource.

By using a state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning scheduler, Hyperion autonomously and continuously optimizes the placement of AI training and inference workloads, aiming to **reduce combined cost and latency by up to 90%** compared to static, manually managed infrastructure.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **üß† AI-Powered Scheduling:** A self-learning scheduler, built on Reinforcement Learning, that makes real-time placement decisions based on cost, latency, resource utilization, and user-defined policies across a global fleet of nodes.

* **‚ö° High-Performance Networking Fabric:** A multi-layer communication fabric built on gRPC over QUIC, enabling secure, sub-10ms control and data plane operations, which is critical for latency-sensitive edge AI applications.

* **‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Predictive Self-Healing:** The system uses time-series ML models on Prometheus telemetry to anticipate node failures and network degradation, proactively rebalancing workloads *before* an outage occurs, ensuring extreme resilience.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The full architectural details are available in our **[Project Hyperion Whitepaper](./docs/whitepaper.md)**.

### High-Level Overview

Hyperion creates a unified control plane that spans multiple cloud providers and a distributed network of edge devices. Users interact with a single, Kubernetes-native API to deploy workloads, and the Hyperion scheduler handles the rest.

### Control Plane & Node Architecture

The control plane is implemented as a Kubernetes Operator in **Go** for robustness and cloud-native integration. A high-performance agent, written in **Rust** for safety and speed, runs on every cloud and edge node, forming the backbone of the distributed system.

## üö¶ Project Status

**Current Phase:** `Phase 0: The Architect's Blueprint`

Project Hyperion is currently in its foundational phase. The core architecture has been designed, the research has been synthesized, and the professional development environment is in place. The next phase involves implementing the core orchestration logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

> **Note:** The project is not yet in a runnable state. This section will be updated as the core components are built.

The future steps to build and run the project will be:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<dileep-u-k>/project-hyperion.git
cd project-hyperion

# Build the Go operator and Rust agent (Makefile target to be added)
make build

# Run tests
make test

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Our vision and execution plan are detailed in the Project Hyperion Whitepaper. The whitepaper provides a comprehensive overview of the system's design, API specifications, and the phased implementation plan
