> ### **The AI Infrastructure Trilemma**
> At planetary-scale, engineering leaders are trapped. They must choose two of three: **low cost** (using spot instances/edge), **low latency** (using premium edge), or **low complexity** (using a single, expensive cloud). Achieving all three creates a brittle, unmanageable system requiring a massive SRE team to operate.

### **üí° The Solution: Breaking the Trilemma**

**Project Hyperion** is an autonomous control plane that breaks this trilemma. It creates a self-optimizing, self-healing fabric from a global pool of heterogeneous compute (cloud, edge, on-prem).

By treating infrastructure as a programmable, AI-driven system, Hyperion achieves what was previously impossible: it delivers **rock-bottom costs** and **ultra-low latency** with near-zero operational overhead. It is the blueprint for a truly autonomous, AI-defined datacenter.

---

### ‚ú® **Key Features**

* **Autonomous Cost & Latency Optimization:** A Reinforcement Learning scheduler that intelligently places workloads, slashing cloud bills by leveraging spot instances and crushing latency by seamlessly shifting compute to the edge.

* **Planetary-Scale Reliability Fabric:** A predictive, self-healing system that uses ML on telemetry to anticipate failures and rebalance workloads *before* outages occur. It's designed to withstand cloud region failures and network partitions with zero human intervention.

* **Unified, High-Performance Control:** A single, Kubernetes-native API for the entire globe, powered by a high-performance **Rust** agent and a **Go**-based operator communicating over a secure, sub-10ms **QUIC** mesh.

---

### **üß† Why This Project Matters**

This project demonstrates a synthesis of skills at the core of modern infrastructure engineering:
* **Elite Distributed Systems Design:** Architecting a fault-tolerant, planetary-scale system that spans hybrid cloud and edge environments.
* **AI-Driven Infrastructure Management:** Applying advanced Machine Learning not just *on* infrastructure, but *to* the infrastructure itself for autonomous optimization and reliability.
* **Principal-Level Engineering Mindset:** Moving beyond just features to solve core business drivers‚Äîradically reducing TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) and operational headcount while maximizing performance and uptime.

### **üèõÔ∏è System Architecture**

The architecture is designed for scalability, resilience, and intelligence. For the complete technical deep-dive, see the **[Project Hyperion Whitepaper](./docs/whitepaper.md)**.

#### **1. High-Level Fabric**
Hyperion unifies public clouds and distributed edge nodes into a single, intelligent fabric, all managed by one control plane.
![Architecture Overview](./docs/architecture-overview.svg)

#### **2. The Control Plane (The Brain)**
Implemented as a Kubernetes Operator in **Go**, the control plane is the system's brain. It watches the state of the entire fabric and uses the RL model to make optimal scheduling decisions.
![Control Plane Architecture](./docs/architecture-control-plane.svg)

#### **3. The Node Agent (The Muscle)**
A high-performance, low-overhead agent written in **Rust** runs on every node. It provides real-time telemetry and acts as the control plane's hands, managing workloads on the machine.
