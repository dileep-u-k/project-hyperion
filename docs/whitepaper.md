## Abstract

Project Hyperion is a next-generation control plane designed to create an autonomous, planetary-scale, AI-defined datacenter. It addresses the escalating cost and complexity of managing AI workloads across heterogeneous infrastructure, including multiple public clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure) and a distributed network of edge devices. By leveraging a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) scheduler, Hyperion transforms a disparate collection of compute resources into a single, self-optimizing fabric. The system continuously and autonomously orchestrates training and inference workloads to meet user-defined goals for cost, latency, and performance, with the objective of reducing operational expenditure and improving response times by up to 90%.

## 1. Background and Problem Statement

The proliferation of large-scale AI models has bifurcated the infrastructure landscape. Large-scale training demands massive, centralized GPU clusters, leading to intense competition for resources and soaring costs on public clouds. Simultaneously, the rise of interactive AI applications requires low-latency inference, pushing compute towards the edge, closer to users.

Managing this hybrid environment is a significant engineering challenge. Organizations are forced to manually provision resources, statically assign workloads, and create complex tooling to bridge the gap between their cloud and edge deployments. This approach is:
* **Inefficient:** Expensive cloud GPUs often sit idle, while edge devices are underutilized.
* **Expensive:** There is no automated mechanism to shift workloads to cheaper spot instances or lower-cost cloud providers in real-time.
* **High-Latency:** Workloads are not dynamically moved to the optimal location based on user proximity and network conditions.
* **Brittle:** The system is reactive, unable to predict and mitigate node failures proactively.

Project Hyperion posits that the solution is not more manual tooling, but a higher level of abstraction: an autonomous control plane that understands the workloads, the infrastructure, and the goals, and manages the entire lifecycle intelligently.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1. Goals

* **Autonomous Workload Orchestration:** To design and build a control plane that automatically schedules AI workloads across a hybrid, multi-cloud, and edge environment.
* **Multi-Objective Optimization:** The scheduling system must optimize for both infrastructure cost and workload latency simultaneously.
* **Unified, Kubernetes-Native API:** To provide users with a single, declarative API, implemented as a Kubernetes CRD, to define and deploy their workloads.
* **High-Performance and Resilient Fabric:** To build a secure, low-latency communication fabric using gRPC over QUIC and implement a predictive self-healing mechanism.
* **Quantifiable Impact:** To demonstrate a cost and/or latency reduction of up to 90% for a set of representative AI workloads compared to a static deployment model.

### 2.2. Non-Goals

* **Not a new container runtime:** Hyperion orchestrates standard OCI containers and will leverage existing runtimes like `containerd`.
* **Not a new service mesh:** Hyperion will integrate with and leverage existing service meshes like Istio for advanced traffic routing, but will not replace them.
* **Not a replacement for Kubernetes:** Hyperion is built *on top* of Kubernetes, extending its capabilities with a domain-specific, intelligent scheduling layer.

## 3. Core Architecture

Hyperion's architecture is composed of a centralized logical Control Plane and a distributed Data Plane powered by agents running on every node.

### 3.1. High-Level Overview

The system abstracts the underlying complexity of multiple cloud providers and edge networks into a single logical resource pool. The Control Plane ingests telemetry from all nodes and uses this global view to make optimal scheduling decisions.

### 3.2. Control Plane Deep Dive

The Control Plane is implemented as a Kubernetes Operator in **Go**. It runs on a dedicated management cluster and serves as the brain of the entire system, making intelligent scheduling decisions based on telemetry and user-defined policies.

### 3.3. Node Architecture

Every machine in the Hyperion fabric, whether a cloud VM or an edge device, runs a lightweight, high-performance agent written in **Rust**. This agent is responsible for reporting telemetry, managing local workloads, and executing commands from the Control Plane.

## 4. API Definitions & Data Models

Hyperion exposes its functionality through a declarative, Kubernetes-native API.

### 4.1. `HyperionWorkload` Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

This is the primary user-facing resource for defining a workload and its desired behavior.

```yaml
apiVersion: hyperion.io/v1alpha1
kind: HyperionWorkload
metadata:
  name: resnet50-inference-job-us-east
spec:
  # --- Workload Definition ---
  # Standard pod template for the workload to be run.
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: inference-server
          image: pytorch/torchserve:latest-gpu
          args: ["torchserve", "--start", "--model-store", "/models", "--models", "resnet50.mar"]
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: "2"
              memory: "4Gi"
              [nvidia.com/gpu](https://nvidia.com/gpu): "1" # Requires 1 GPU.

  # --- Hyperion Scheduling Policy ---
  policy:
    # Goal for the scheduler: "cost", "latency", or a balanced "default".
    goal: latency
    
    # Placement constraints for the workload.
    constraints:
      # Hard constraints: must be met.
      geographies: ["US", "EU"] # Can only run in these regions.
      clouds: ["aws", "gcp"] # Can only run on these providers.
      
      # Soft constraints: hints for the scheduler.
      preferSpot: true # The scheduler should prefer cheaper spot instances if available.
      
    # Data locality information.
    data:
      source: "s3://my-training-data-us-east-1/dataset"
      locality: "aws:us-east-1" # Hint that the data is close to this region.
```

4.2. Agent gRPC Service (Protobuf)

This defines the communication protocol between the agent and the control plane.

    syntax = "proto3";
    package agent.v1;

    service AgentService {
    // Registers a node with the control plane and returns its unique ID.
    rpc RegisterNode(RegisterNodeRequest) returns (RegisterNodeResponse);

    // A bidirectional stream for sending telemetry up and receiving commands down.
    rpc Stream(stream StreamMessage) returns (stream StreamMessage);
    }

    // Node capabilities sent during registration.
    message NodeCapabilities {
    string cpu_arch = 1;
    int64 memory_bytes = 2;
    repeated GPU gpus = 3;
    map<string, string> labels = 4; // e.g., cloud, region, etc.
    }

    message GPU {
    string uuid = 1;
    string model = 2;
    int64 memory_bytes = 3;
    }

    // Telemetry sent from the agent to the control plane.
    message Telemetry {
    float cpu_utilization_percent = 1;
    repeated GPUStatus gpu_status = 2;
    NetworkStatus network_status = 3;
    }

5. Deep Dive: The AI Scheduling Loop

The core of Hyperion is its closed-loop, RL-based scheduler.

State (S): The state of the world is a snapshot of all telemetry collected by Prometheus. This includes: GPU utilization on every node, current cloud spot instance pricing, network latency between all major nodes, and the queue of pending HyperionWorkload objects.

Action (A): For a given pending workload, the action is the selection of a specific node (e.g., aws-us-east-1-p4d.24xlarge-spot-instance-123) on which to place it.

Reward (R): After placing the workload, the system observes the outcome. The reward function is a tunable equation: Reward = (w1 / cost_per_hour) + (w2 / p99_latency_ms). If a placement violates a hard constraint (like data sovereignty), the reward is a large negative number.

Learning: Over thousands of placement decisions, the RL model (using an algorithm like PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization) learns a policy that maps states to actions in a way that maximizes the cumulative future reward. It learns, for instance, that placing latency-sensitive workloads on distant but cheap spot instances results in a poor reward, and it will stop making those decisions.

6. Benchmarking & Success Metrics

To validate the "90% reduction" claim, a series of benchmark tests will be conducted.

Testbed: A hybrid cluster consisting of nodes in AWS (us-east-1), GCP (europe-west-1), and two local NVIDIA Jetson devices.

Workloads:

Latency-Sensitive: A ResNet-50 image classification inference service.

Cost-Sensitive: A small-scale BERT model training job.

Control Group: The workloads will be deployed statically to a single cloud provider (AWS us-east-1) using default Kubernetes scheduling.

Experiment Group: The workloads will be managed by Project Hyperion.

Metrics:

P99 Inference Latency (ms): Measured from the client's perspective.

Cloud Spend ($/hour): Measured via cloud provider billing APIs.

Training Job Completion Time (minutes): For the BERT workload.

7. Project Roadmap

The project will be executed in four distinct phases:

Phase 0: The Architect's Blueprint: Research, architecture design, and environment setup. (Current)

Phase 1: The Core Orchestrator: Implement the K8s operator, the Rust agent, and a basic, rule-based scheduler.
